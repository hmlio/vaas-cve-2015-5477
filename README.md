# Vulnerability as a Service - CVE 2015-5477
A Debian (Wheezy) Linux system with a vulnerable version of bind9 to showcase CVS-2015-5477.

# Overview
This docker container is based on Debian Wheezy and has been modified to use a vulernable version of bind9 and the matching additional dependencies.

# Usage
Get the container with `docker pull hmlio/vaas-cve-2015-5477`.

Run the container with a port mapping (for the maximum "Dude! This sucks!" effect I recommend starting the container without detaching it as a background process):
`docker run -p 53:53/udp hmlio/vaas-cve-2015-5477`

You should be able to do DNS queries via the container:
`dig @<your-ip> hml.io any`

# Exploitation
At the time of this writing, a proof of concept exploit is available <a href="https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/132926/BIND-TKEY-Query-Denial-Of-Service.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

From another terminal windows fire up the exploit like so:
`python exploit.py <your-ip>`

Change back to the original terminal window where you started the container in the foreground and you should see someting similar to this:

``` sh
